This was yet another course from Udacity 
(https://www.udacity.com/course/designing-restful-apis--ud388). 

In this course I learned the best practices for making REST APIs, which was my 
main goal, but I also learned how to use other interesting tools, such as Flask, 
Redis and SQL Alchemy. 

In this course I worked with the following technologies:

 - Python
 - Google Maps APIs
 - FourSquare APIs
 - OpenStreetMaps
 - Oauth 2.0
 - Redis
 - Flask
 - SQL Alchemy

The link for the resources of the course is (https://github.com/udacity/APIs) 
but I strongly recommend you use my exercises instead as they have been fixed, 
and all of them work, unlike the exercises in the repository of the course which 
have bugs sometimes.

A good investment of my time overall!
